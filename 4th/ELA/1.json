(e.g., they are lost, or they disagree with a friend). \n3. **Change:** How does the setting or conflict make the character act or feel? Did they start sad and become brave?

His grandpa's old dog was sick and needed help. Leo had to learn to be calm and quiet to help the dog get better. When he returned to the city, he wasn't jumpy anymore. He felt calm and capable.' \n\n**Let's analyze:** The **setting** changed from a nervous city to a quiet farm. The **conflict** was the sick dog. This made Leo **change** from a 'nervous and jumpy' person to a 'calm and capable' person."

The soil is just too stubborn.\" \n\nOne sweltering afternoon, while exploring a dry creek bed, Elara spotted something impossible. Tucked in the shadow of a large boulder, a single, brilliant blue wildflower was thriving. It wasn't just surviving; it was beautiful. She knelt, studying it. Its roots weren't in the clay at all, but in a tiny pocket of dark, rich soil trapped in a crack in the rock.\n\nA new idea, small and bright as the flower, sparked in her mind. \"If the soil won't come to the garden,\" she whispered, \"then the garden must come to the soil.\"\n\nHer new project began the next day, not with a shovel, but with a wagon. She went to the town's \"Fix-it-Field,\" a polite name for the dump. The other townsfolk saw rusted-out buckets, cracked pots, a wheelbarrow with a broken wheel, and even a pair of leaky old work boots. Elara saw a garden.\n\nShe hauled her treasures back to her small yard, right under the nose of her grumpy neighbor, Mr. Hemlock. \"Wasting your time, girl,\" he grumbled from his porch. \"You can't fix that junk, and you certainly can't grow nothin' in it.\"\n\nElara didn't argue. Her hands ached as she scrubbed the rust and dirt. Her arms burned as she hauled buckets of good, dark soil from the creek bed to fill her strange collection of containers. She traded her last comic book for a small pouch of \"Tough Tomato\" and \"Marigold\" seeds from the general store. She planted them, watered them, and waited.\n\nFor two weeks, nothing happened. The clay ground of her yard seemed to mock her. Mr. Hemlock just shook his head, looking smug. Elara felt a familiar frustration creeping in. Maybe they were all right. Maybe nothing good could grow here.\n\nShe was about to give up when she saw it.

A cascade of orange marigolds spilled from the broken wheelbarrow. Green bean vines twisted their way up the leg of a wobbly old chair.

          "stimulus": "Elara sighed, kicking a puff of red dust from the path. She lived in a town called Barren Bluffs, and the name was certainly accurate. The ground was hard-packed, reddish clay, and the few plants that survived were thorny, drab bushes. Elara longed for the vibrant, colorful gardens she saw in her library books, but everyone said the same thing: \"You can't grow anything in the Bluffs, child. The soil is just too stubborn.\" \n\nOne sweltering afternoon, while exploring a dry creek bed, Elara spotted something impossible. Tucked in the shadow of a large boulder, a single, brilliant blue wildflower was thriving. It wasn't just surviving; it was beautiful. She knelt, studying it. Its roots weren't in the clay at all, but in a tiny pocket of dark, rich soil trapped in a crack in the rock.\n\nA new idea, small and bright as the flower, sparked in her mind. \"If the soil won't come to the garden,\" she whispered, \"then the garden must come to the soil.\"\n\nHer new project began the next day, not with a shovel, but with a wagon. She went to the town's \"Fix-it-Field,\" a polite name for the dump. The other townsfolk saw rusted-out buckets, cracked pots, a wheelbarrow with a broken wheel, and even a pair of leaky old work boots. Elara saw a garden.\n\nShe hauled her treasures back to her small yard, right under the nose of her grumpy neighbor, Mr. Hemlock. \"Wasting your time, girl,\" he grumbled from his porch. \"You can't fix that junk, and you certainly can't grow nothin' in it.\"\n\nElara didn't argue. Her hands ached as she scrubbed the rust and dirt. Her arms burned as she hauled buckets of good, dark soil from the creek bed to fill her strange collection of containers. She traded her last comic book for a small pouch of \"Tough Tomato\" and \"Marigold\" seeds from the general store. She planted them, watered them, and waited.\n\nFor two weeks, nothing happened. The clay ground of her yard seemed to mock her. Mr. Hemlock just shook his head, looking smug. Elara felt a familiar frustration creeping in. Maybe they were all right. Maybe nothing good could grow here.\n\nShe was about to give up when she saw it. Poking through the dark soil in the old work boot was a tiny, perfect loop of green.\n\nWeeks later, Elara's yard was an explosion of life. A bright red tomato peeked out of a tin can. A cascade of orange marigolds spilled from the broken wheelbarrow. Green bean vines twisted their way up the leg of a wobbly old chair. It was the strangest, most beautiful garden Barren Bluffs had ever seen.\n\nOne evening, Mr. Hemlock stood at her fence. He wasn't grumbling. He stared for a long time at the tomato in the can. \"Never would have thought...\" he said, his voice quiet. \"You made something from nothing.\"\n\nElara smiled, handing him a bright red, perfectly ripe tomato. She looked at her wonderful, weird garden, born from junk and stubbornness. She hadn't just grown plants; she had grown a new idea in a place that had forgotten how.",
